## Current Projects

The following projects rely on the [Readium Architecture](https://readium.org/architecture/). 

- [Readium Mobile](https://readium.org/mobile/): the Readium toolkit dedicated to iOS and Android reading apps; written in Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android).
- [Readium Desktop](https://readium.org/desktop/): the Readium toolkit dedicated to Windows, MacOS and Linux apps; written in typescript, based on node.js and Electron.js.
- [Readium Web](https://readium.org/web/): the Readium toolkit dedicated to Web apps managing Readium Web Publications; written in typescript.

In the medium term, a new project will be released: 

- Readium Publication Server: a server for Readium Web Publications; written in Go and node.js. This is the server companion of Readium Web for when the original content is in EPUB or is a Readium package.

The [Readium LCP](https://readium.org/lcp-specs/) DRM specification is maintained under the Readium Foundation umbrella. 
Same for the open-source [Readium LCP Server](https://github.com/readium/readium-lcp-server), [Readium LCP client for Swift](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-swift), [Readium LCP client for Kotlin](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-kotlin) and [Readium LCP client for node.js](https://github.com/readium/r2-lcp-js).

Note that the management of the Readium LCP ecosystem is handled by [EDRLab](https://www.edrlab.org), acting as Certification Authority.
